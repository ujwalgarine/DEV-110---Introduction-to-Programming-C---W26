    - .NET 9.0 SDK
    - Visual Studio Code
    - Git
    - Required VS Code extensions

2. **Fork and Clone This Repository**

    ```bash
    # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DEV-110---Introduction-to-Programming-C---W26.git
    cd DEV-110---Introduction-to-Programming-C---W26
    ```

3. **Test Your Setup**

    ```bash
    # Quick test
    # Mac/Linux:
    ./test 1

    # Windows:
    dotnet test modules\week-01-hello-github\tests

    # Or navigate to a module
    # Mac/Linux:
    cd modules/week-01-hello-github/starter

    # Windows:
    cd modules\week-01-hello-github\starter

    dotnet run
    ```

---

## 📖 Weekly Workflow

### Starting an Assignment

1. Navigate to the week's module folder
2. Read the `README.md` for instructions
3. Work in the `starter/` folder
4. Run tests often:
    - Mac/Linux: `dotnet test ../tests`
    - Windows: `dotnet test ..\tests`

### Submitting Your Work

1. Commit your changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Completed Week X"`
2. Push to GitHub: `git push origin student/<your-name>`
3. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
4. Check automated test results

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Code

Each assignment includes automated tests that run:

- **Locally:** When you run `./test <week>`
- **On GitHub:** Automatically when you push code

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test any week (from project root)
# Mac/Linux:
./test 1        # Test Week 1
./test 2        # Test Week 2
./test all      # Test all weeks

# Windows:
dotnet test modules\week-01-hello-github\tests
dotnet test modules\week-02-calculator-lite\tests
# etc.

# Or from within a module
# Mac/Linux:
cd modules/week-01-hello-github/starter
bash ../../run-tests.sh ../tests

# Windows:
cd modules\week-01-hello-github\starter
dotnet test ..\tests
```

**Features:**

- ✅/❌ Clear visual indicators
- 💡 Helpful tips for fixing failures
- 🎨 Color-coded output
- Filters out confusing build messages

See [Testing Quick Reference](docs/TESTING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for more details.

## 📝 Code Style & Formatting

This repository uses automated code formatting and linting:

### Auto-Format Your Code

```bash
# Format all files
dotnet format

# Check formatting without changing files
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
```

### In VS Code

- **Format on Save** is enabled automatically
- **Manual Format:** `Shift+Option+F` (Mac) or `Shift+Alt+F` (Windows)

See [Style Guide](docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md) for detailed style rules.
