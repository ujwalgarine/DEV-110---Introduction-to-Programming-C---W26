# Week 5: Guess the Number - Study Notes

**Name:**

## Loop Types

**How is a `do-while` loop different from a `while` loop?**
[Explain when each loop is best used]

Answer:

**Where did you use a `do-while` loop in this assignment and why?**
[Describe the input validation use]

Answer:

**Where did you use a `while` loop and why?**
[Describe the guessing loop]

Answer:

**Where did you use a `for` loop and why?**
[Describe the rounds loop]

Answer:

## Input Validation

**Why did you create a helper method for input validation?**
[Explain how it avoids repeating code for max value and rounds]

Answer:

**How did you make sure the max value was between 10 and 100?**
[Explain your range check logic]

Answer:

**How did you make sure the number of rounds was between 1 and 3?**
[Explain your range check logic]

Answer:

**How did you handle invalid input (non-numbers)?**
[Explain how int.TryParse works]

Answer:

## Guessing Logic

**How did you compare the guess to the secret number?**
[Explain the if/else logic for too low, too high, and correct]

Answer:

**How did you count the number of guesses?**
[Explain where you incremented the counter]

Answer:

## Random Numbers

**How did you generate the secret number?**
[Explain Random and Next(min, max)]

Answer:

**Why does `Random.Next(1, max + 1)` include the max value?**
[Explain why +1 is needed]

Answer:

## Testing and Debugging

**What inputs did you test to confirm your loops worked correctly?**
[List several test cases]

Answer:

**What bugs or errors did you encounter and fix?**
[Describe any logic or loop errors]
