# Week 8: Mad Libs (Structure + Debugging) - Study Notes

**Name:** replace-with-your-name

## Program Structure

**What helper methods did you create (and what does each one do)?**
[List your methods and briefly describe each]

Answer:

**Why is it helpful to move code out of `Main` and into helper methods?**
[Explain how this improves readability and reduces bugs]

Answer:

## Data Modeling

**What is the purpose of the `StoryTemplate` class in this assignment?**
[Explain what data it stores and why]

Answer:

**How did using a template make it easier to support two different stories?**
[Explain how the same logic can work with different prompts/text]

Answer:

## Testing and Debugging

**Where did you set a breakpoint while debugging this program (what line or method)?**
[Be specific - example: inside GenerateStory, at the beginning of CollectWords, etc.]

Answer:

**What did you learn from stepping through your code line by line?**
[Describe how watching execution helped you understand flow or find bugs]

Answer:

**What bug or logic mistake did you encounter (and how did you fix it)?**
[Describe a real issue you ran into and how breakpoints/stepping helped]

Answer:

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer:

## Reflection

**What would you improve if you had more time?**
[Ideas: more templates, better formatting, more validation, etc.]

Answer:

**How did breaking your program into smaller parts help you debug?**
[Explain the connection between structure and debugging]
