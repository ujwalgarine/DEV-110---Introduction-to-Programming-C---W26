# Week 8: Mad Libs (Structure + Debugging) - Starter

## Summary

This is the **starter** project for Week 8.

You will build a two-template Mad Libs app that practices **program structure** (small methods + a simple class) and **basic debugging**.

## What You Need To Do

- Open `Program.cs`
- Follow the numbered TODO steps
- Keep your prompts and messages **exactly** as required in the assignment README

---

## How To Run

```bash
cd modules/week-08-mad-libs/starter
dotnet run
```

---

## How To Test

```bash
cd modules/week-08-mad-libs/starter
dotnet test ../tests
```

---

## Tips

- Break your code into small methods (input helpers, template selection, story building).
- Use breakpoints to debug (set one in your story-building logic).
- If tests fail, compare your prompts to the README.
