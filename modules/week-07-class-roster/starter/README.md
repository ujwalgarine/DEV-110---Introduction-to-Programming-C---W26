- Follow the numbered TODO steps
- Keep your prompts and messages **exactly** as required in the assignment README

```

## Tips

- Use `count` to control your loops (not `array.Length`).
- Keep the roster capacity at **3**.
- Use a `for` loop when reading multiple students into arrays.
- Use a `foreach` loop when printing the roster.
