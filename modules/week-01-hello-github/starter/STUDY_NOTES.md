# Week 1: Hello, GitHub - Study Notes

**Name:** Ujwal Garine


## Development Environment Setup

**Software installed and versions:**

- .NET SDK 9.0
- Visual Studio Code
- Git
- VS Code C# extension

**Operating system:**

macOS (Apple Silicon)


## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**

Getting the correct .NET version to match the project requirements.

**How you solved it:**

I read the error messages, used the terminal, and installed the correct .NET SDK version using Homebrew.

**Most confusing concept:**

Understanding how the dotnet CLI commands work together.


## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**

It prints text to the terminal so the user can see output from the program.

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**

It contains the main entry point where the program starts running.

**What does `dotnet run` do?**

It builds the project and then runs the compiled program.


## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**

- `git add` stages changes
- `git commit` saves changes locally with a message
- `git push` uploads changes to GitHub

**Why do we create branches?**

Branches allow us to work on changes safely without affecting the main code.


## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**

1. How to set up a C# development environment using .NET and VS Code
2. How to run and test a C# program using the dotnet CLI
3. How Git and GitHub are used to manage and submit assignments

**How this connects to professional development:**

These skills are essential for real-world software development, collaboration, and version control.
